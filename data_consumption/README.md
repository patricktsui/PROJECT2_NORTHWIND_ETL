# Data Visualisation on AWS
The denormalized big table, containing comprehensive Northwind sales data, was seamlessly connected to Preset. Within Preset, two key semantic layer metrics were created: "Total Revenue" and "Average Order Value," providing consistent, reusable calculations across all visualizations. Leveraging these metrics and the rich dataset, it developed a bar chart displaying total revenue by product category, a line graph tracking average order value by country, and a bar chart showing sales distribution among countries. These visualszations were then assembled into a cohesive dashboard, offering a holistic view of Northwind's sales performance. The dashboard provides at-a-glance insights into top-selling products, revenue trends, and regional sales patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making for the Northwind business.

These screenshots provide visual documentation of the Preset configuration, individual chart creation, and the final assembled dashboard, showcasing the transformation of raw data into actionable business insights.
